### Asset compilation

Install [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and compile the assets:

```
  $ npm install # to install dependencies
  $ npm run build # will concat/compress css and js
```

During development just run `gulp` in a separate console for continuous compilation.
(Gulp will watch for changes in the js/ and css/ directories and run the respective tasks.)
